### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have a bachelor degree in Electronics and I have been working in multi-discipline projects since 2006, mostly working on platforms like:

- FPGAS: Spartan and Virtex Series
- Microcontrolers: PIC Microcontrolers 18F series from Microchip
- Embedded boards: Raspberry, Arduino, ESP32 based, Beaglebone Black.
  
I'm currently on my learning journey in Data Analytics, doing courses and reading books related to Data Analysis, SQL, Python and some more.
